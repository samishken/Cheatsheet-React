# Reusable Components
* In general Components Should Be F.I.R.S.T. (focused, independent, reusable, small, testable)

* What is the benefit of creating Reusable components?
    * We want to design the COMMON desing elements like (buttons, form fields, layout components, etc.) into reusable components with well-defined interfaces. That way, the next time we need to build some UI, we can write much less code. The result will be faster development time, fewer bugs, and fewer bytes down the wire.
    * We break parts of a user interface down into the smallest possible units. These lower level components can be reused over and over again, more frequently than more complex components.

* Define the following design types: Atoms, Molecules & Organisms

* PropTypes
