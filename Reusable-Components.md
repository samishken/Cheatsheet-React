# Reusable Components
* In general Components Should be F.I.R.S.T. (focused, independent, reusable, small, testable)

* What is the benefit of creating Reusable components?
    * We want to design the COMMON desing elements like (buttons, form fields, layout components, etc.) into reusable components with well-defined interfaces. That way, the next time we need to build some UI, we can write much less code. The result will be faster development time, fewer bugs, and fewer bytes down the wire.
    * We break parts of a user interface down into the smallest possible units. These lower level components can be reused over and over again, more frequently than more complex components.

* Define Atomic Design’s & five major stages — atoms -> molecules -> organisms -> templates -> types: 
    * Atomic design is methodology for creating design systems. 
    * Atoms, Molecules & Organisms  
    * Atoms are basically the smallest indivisible bits of UI. Think of buttons, links, inputs, etc. 
    * Molecules are combinations of Atoms
    * Organisms are groups of molecules joined together to form a relatively complex, distinct section of an interface.

* PropTypes
    - PropTypes exports a range of validators that can be used to make sure the data you receive is valid. (Name field is String)

* Define the following design types: Atoms, Molecules & Organisms
